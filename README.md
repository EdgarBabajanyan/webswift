# **Project Webswift**

Get ready for an awesome (yet early) experience of web browsing. Webswift is a light weight web browser designed to make browsing easy on the eyes (with our darkmode styling) while also providing a swift experience.

This app is built in Python 3.6 and utilizes PyQT5 for styling

# Starting the Application

Install PyQt5 Dependencies

`pip install PyQt5`
`pip install qt-material`
`pip install PyQtWebEngine`

Then, run the Python program and enjoy seamless, lightning fast speeds!
